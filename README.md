# CppHelper
Containg useful things.

With those shortcuts, you can be faster in writing the code and the code is more readable.
Besides those shortcuts, you will get different functions written in MACRO.


_**WARNING**_
If you want to use those macros, you must not use this style for parameter names outside of macros: 
> `_xxx_`

_**For examples see Examples.cpp.**_

## List of functionality:
### Math:
- FACTORIAL (Math) as macro

- COMPLEX NUMBER as macro (NOT FINISHED)
- BIT MANIPULATION written in macro:
    - print number in bits
    - set bit to 1
    - set bit to 0
    - check for even number
    - check if number is positive
    - multiply number by two
    - devide number by two
    - switch sign of the number
    - multiply two unsigned numbers
    - count of all 1's in the number
    - count of all different bits in two numbers
    - bits length of the number
