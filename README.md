# CppHelper
Containg useful things.

With those shortcuts, you can be faster in writing the code and the code is more readable.
Besides those shortcuts, you will get different functions written in MACRO.


_**WARNING**_
If you want to use those macros, you must not use this style for parameter names outside of macros: 
> `_xxx_`

_**For examples see main.cpp.**_

### List of functionality:
- shortcuts for std::cout, cin, cerr, clog, endl
